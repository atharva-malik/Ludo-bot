LudBot is the world's first open-source bot for the game of Ludo! It is fully functional and ready to be deployed with a sample scene included.

## Features

- Ready to deploy
- Written in clean code and easily editable.
- Comes with base scene
- Written in the robust language, C#

## Technology Used

LudBot is made with one main technology, [Unity 2022] but uses lots of different ideas/technologies in the background, like [C#] and a mini-max style development approach, to make it work.

## Installation

Install the repository, download the [Unity 2022] version, and add the project through Unity Hub and then run it as any other Unity project!
